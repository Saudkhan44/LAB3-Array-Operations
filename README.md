# Array Operations – Menu Driven Program

## 📌 About

This is a simple **Java program** that demonstrates **array operations** using a **menu-driven system**.
The project is built to understand **basic data structure concepts** like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.

## 🎯 Features

The program provides the following operations on an integer array:

1. **Traversal** – Display all elements of the array.
2. **Insertion** – Insert an element:

    * At the **beginning**
    * At a **given position**
    * At the **end**
3. **Deletion** – Delete an element:

    * From the **beginning**
    * From a **given position**
    * From the **end**
4. **Searching** – Search for elements in two ways:

    * By **value** (Linear Search)
    * By **index** (direct access)
5. **Exit** – Quit the program.

## 🛠️ How It Works

* The program uses **arrays** with shifting of elements for insertion and deletion.
* **Switch-case** statements are used to create a user-friendly menu.
* Searching is done using **linear search** for values and direct indexing for positions.
* Overflow and underflow conditions are checked for safe array operations.

## 📖 Learning Objective

* Understand how **arrays work in Java**.
* Learn about **shifting elements** during insertion and deletion.
* Practice **searching techniques**.
* Build confidence with **menu-driven programs** using loops and switch-case.
